Tip3 = "Remember to turn off your nanite gun when flying a Ga'Taraan Scout (Press 1 to select the gun, 2 to select the nanite -- press the same number again to select all-fire again).";
Tip4 = "When not sure what to do, deploy more probes.";
Tip5 = "Click and drag with the right mouse button in F3 to set a waypoint off the grid.";
Tip6 = "Click on the arrow on the minimap. It will show you rocks, HE (Helium) levels, etc.";
Tip7 = "Alephs are arranged in sectors geometrically. Use F3 to scout the map.";
Tip8 = "Place your probes off-plane (above and below the grid) to lower the chances of them being found.";
Tip9 = "Did you know you can ripcord while boosting? Hit R while holding the boost button.";
Tip10 = "Rixian combat pods only fire on what you have targetted when you deploy them (they won't switch targets with you).";
Tip11 = "Phoenix bombers (and all Nix piloted ships) can *NOT* be repaired with a nanite gun.";
Tip12 = "A Belter Stealth Fighter can be an awesome nan for a Stealth Bomber";
Tip13 = "Ctrl-w lets you select all weapons. Pressing 1,2 or 3 will activate that gun only.";

Tip18 = "Place your probes off-plane (above and below the grid) to lesson the chances of them being found.";
Tip19 = "When turreting, your throttle controls act as a 'zoom' feature; use this to your advantage.";
Tip20 = "Hold down forward thrust when getting rammed in a bomber, it will carry your speed longer.";
Tip21 = "Allegiance is a competitive TEAM-based game. Players must work together to complete goals, and commanders may eject players who are not contributing to their teams.";
Tip22 = "The Allegiance Community has dedicated a LOT of time into helping everyone play Allegiance. Make sure to check out the many resources available to you.";
Tip23 = "After training, learn basic gameplay and technology on the Newbie servers. Once you've mastered the basics, join the vets and don't look back.";
Tip24 = "Games with an imbalanced skill are NOT fun. If you're new, don't join the team with the most new players.";
Tip25 = "As with all communities, Allegiance has 'good apples' and 'bad apples.' Don't let the bad ones ruin your fun.";
Tip26 = "Enemy nans will often be with important targets. Attack the nans first because any damage you attempt to inflict on the main target will be instantly repaired.)";
Tip27 = "If you are too close to a friendly con it will think you're on a collision course, and try to avoid you. This can delay it's building time.";
Tip28 = "Both sheilds and missiles raise your radar signature, making it easier for the enemy to spot you.  Keep them in cargo when you don't need them.";
Tip29 = "Picking up teammates who are in a lifepod transports them instantly back to base, where they can immediately launch to help defend, attack, or whatever again.";
Tip30 = "If no one probes then the enemy will always surprise you, always have the upper hand, and your team will lose. This is a fact.";
Tip31 = "Exploring with an int or fig does not work because their scan range is very low.";
Tip32 = "Do not attempt to command on the regular server until you have a LOT of experince.  You need to know other aspects of the game well to be a successful commander.";

Tip36 = "Bios pods have the unique ability to ripcord.  They also are able to equip a heavy cloak on almost all their ships.";
Tip37 = "You can pick up objects dropped by your enemy or spawned randomly.  The 'T' symbol in F3 indicates an unresearched technology.  Pick them up and return them to base.";
Tip38 = "Commanders use the team's income as they feel is best for the team.  Not all ships are free.  You must request to purchase them, but the commander will not always say yes.";
Tip39 = "Pay attention to the map preview shown before entering a game.  Learn what each map looks like and you will be able to find alephs much faster.";
Tip40 = "Some of the best players in the game fly with a mouse and some fly with a joystick.  A couple even fly with controllers.  You should avoid using the keyboard to fly.";
