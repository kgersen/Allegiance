R8 WIP

Version 1.2 Release (02/26/2004)

The release is a refresh that adds additional files in the \test folder. "Pigs" were the bots the Allegiance team used for testing Allegiance. These are mostly sample scripts which will be helpful in both testing and developing intelligent drones.”

--------------------------------
This release is a refresh that adds some additional files need to build the product.
The additional files can be found under the newly added \test folder.

Version 1.0 Release (02/05/2004)
--------------------------------
Allegiance was an incredible experience for the dev team. We were all first-timers, trying our best to create a fun, innovative, challenging game. We think we succeeded there, even if we failed at being commercially successful. Allegiance seemed to die all too soon—for a variety of reasons. But we’ve been amazed at the level to which some of the Allegiance fans have remained hard-core. We’re astounded at the progress that has been made at creating new factions, hosting new servers, replacing authentication, etc. It seems that Allegiance hasn’t really died.
 

With that in mind, we’re releasing the Allegiance source code to the community. 
 

It took some work to come to this decision. The chief concern was that the dev team (who are all off doing new projects) would have to take too much time to reconstruct the build environment to work with the latest tools, pretty up the code, scrub the comments, etc. Since it was impossible to free up the time for the dev team to do this work, we were left with the choice to release it as is (unsupported) or skip it altogether. Given where the Allegiance community has gone with NO SOURCES WHATSOEVER we decided that it would serve the community better to release the sources unsupported.

Note: The sources are built to point to an authentication service that no longer exists (used to be the one used by the zone). If anyone cares about running the Club version of the Allegiance server, they will have to roll their own authentication solution. But with the sources, it should be pretty straight-forward.

Voila. We hope that in some way this fans the burning embers of Allegiance. 


Thanks for playing!
