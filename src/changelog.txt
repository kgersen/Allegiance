KGJV - july 2008 - major cleanup & DX9 merge :

based on "FAZR5Contrib Rev 192"

prerequisites: VS2005 or VS2008 and latest DXSDK (jun 2008) (just point VS200x to DXSDK include and lib directories)

	-moved all Visual Studio files to specific directories outside 'src'
	-added VS 2008 projects (no code changes except 4 'cast' in TCLib\PropertyClass.h due to a change of ATL_PROPMAP_ENTRY definition) - builds go in 'objs9' directory
	-merged DX9 Doofus' work replacing DX7:
		 - inlined all "#ifdef BUILD_DX9", left a comment however
		 - moved 'user settings' code from wintrek to engine (DeviceModeDX9, VideoSettingsDX9)
		 - changed HKLM_3DSETTINGS as parameter instead of symbol
	-upgraded inputengine to DirectInput8 (to build and link happy with latest DXSDK)
	-made projects independent of DirectX include except for Engine & Effect
		-changed zlib.h to fully remove DX include - Added a dynamic check in Win32App class (Win32App::IsBuildDX9())
		-globally renamed D3DCOLORVALUE to COLORVALUE and defined it in zlib\olddxdefns.h
		-since DPlay is deprecated and not available in latest DXDSK: added Dplay include and lib files to src/Inc and src/lib
		-removed DPlay include from AGC by moving MSGVER in its own include file (Inc\MessageVersion.h)
		-removed <d3dtypes.h> from Inc\messagecore.h
		-moved 'Color Codes' stuff from engine(font) to zlib(color)
